# Differences between Pascal Case and Camel Case in C# 

    This repository is an exercise of best practices of syntax in C#. It was helpful for me, and it may be useful for other C# newbies as well.

        I made this by observing other scripts and assimilating some good practices, which makes this a self taught project. ðŸš€

            This wasn't made to execute anything, really, it's simply a way to practice conventions in C#. However, if you want to run the project for any reason, have in mind that this is a .NET console type project, so all you have to do is execute the program.cs files in one of the folders with the "dotnet run" command.
